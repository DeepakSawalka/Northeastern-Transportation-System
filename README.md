2. Buddy Walk

Project Description:- 

We are developing a transportation database system, specifically for the northeastern community,  where the source will be Northeastern University for the traveler to go to his desired location which will comprise (Restaurants, Banks, Grocery stores, Street Names, and Apartments).
Once the location is determined, he will be able to see the mode of transportation to use, and accordingly, the time and route will be displayed in the database which will also include the street name and the percentage of crime rate on that street. This will be very helpful for commuters who are uncertain of which streets are safe or not, especially at night, so the safety parameter is distinct. The user can choose his or her route to the destination in accordance with it.

The project's second component is the Buddy Walk feature, which entails a website where the user must enter information such as Name Email destination time range of half an hour when he wants to go, and the mode of transportation that he wants to use. After a while, he can see the information of the people who are commuting in the same direction, after which they can coordinate a meeting place and proceed to the destination as suitable.
